Steven Perng is a self-motivated and enthusiastic engineer who aspires to change the world we live in by designing innovative and sustainable infrastructure. With a Class 1 Honours in his Bachelor of Engineering and Science, his technical expertise is unparalleled and is now seeking an opportunity to apply this knowledge in a professional setting. 
Having completed an internship at ACM Civil & Structural Engineers, Steven has developed an insight to how an engineering consultancy operates. His responsibilities included managing multiple projects simultaneously, liaising with clients and analysing structural drawings. Furthermore, he implemented Inducta (reinforced concrete software) to be permanently used at ACM for all future projects, significantly improving the accuracy and speed of delivering solutions to residential projects. Overall, this experience refined Steven’s problem solving and critical thinking skills as well as broaden his understanding of the construction industry.   
On the other hand, Steven is employed as a Mathematics teacher at Australia ABC Tutoring Centre where he inspires students to reach their maximum learning potential. He achieves this by constantly checking in with students to measure progress and provides extra support and resources to students on Google Classroom. Hence, Steven possesses a strong client focus and understands that their success is his success.  
During his leisure time, you will find Steven participating in weekly table tennis and badminton socials where he is motivated to keep fit as well as catch up with friends. Consequently, Steven has developed thorough teamwork and interpersonal skills; qualities that are paramount for a successful engineer.
